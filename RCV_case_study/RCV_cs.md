### Correlations are relationships between two or more variables.  
That's it, just relationships.  
Essentially it highlights a correlation between the construction of 5g towers and Covid-19
cases breaking out. Suspicious, right? Well no, it's clear that while the data does somewhat
correlate, you might **also** notice that the data correlates roughly with the population density
in the United States, as well as the locations of major cities. Doesn't it seem more plausible
that the people constructing 5g towers would focus on major cities so that they can reach the
most amount of people? And that major cities would have more Covid-19 cases because they have
more people? To me, it seems absurd to conclude that this data implies that 5g towers cause
Covid-19, but to other people, this was their actual belief that they took just as seriously as
