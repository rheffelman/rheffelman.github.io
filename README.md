## Hi, my name is Ryan Heffelman, and this is a GitHub repo for my personal website.


 This website started as a project in a gen-ed art class that I didn't really want to do (I'm a Computer Science and Data Science Major), so I made certain portions of this website, and it wasn't very useful. Then another more interesting class came along and also had a website requirement, so I re-used the work I did here. Then a 3rd class came along...
