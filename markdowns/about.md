## Experience
    - I worked as a freelance intern in 2024 with Hoth Intelligence, a medical imaging/computer vision company. I made an optimized ICP registration library from scratch in C++ for use on-board VR/AR headsets (Hololens, Magic Leap 2) worn by brain surgeons during brain surgery.

    - I worked as a researcher in 2024 with the Carthage College Mathematics Department. I made a CNN in pytorch/python that predicts the density of a hanging cable given the shape of the cable. I also made a simulation in python that solves the shape that a hanging cable will make given a density function (any density function).

    - I worked as a Media Services Technician at Carthage College Media Services from 2022-2025.
