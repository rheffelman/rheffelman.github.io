## My Questions:
1. Who stands to gain or lose from implementing RCV?
2. Is FPTP voting discriminatory? If so, against who?

## 2018 Maine Data Analysis
[The dataset used can be found here](https://www.rcvresources.org/data-clearinghouse)

Here are the results when you treat the ranked-choice ballots of the election as FPTP ballots and tabulate it as such:

Here are the results of the ranked-choice ballots computed with a Borda count:
![RCV_plot_2](./materials/RCV_outcome.png)

As you can see, there is a discrepancy. When using Borda count the independent candidates are now in the race, and the Republican/Democrat results aren't skewed, they are roughly the same proportionally.

### So is FPTP discriminatory against independents, or is RCV/Borda discriminatory against Republicans/Democrats? 

I'd like to argue that FPTP is discriminatory against independents because the results correlate significantly better with the known party affiliation demographics:

[source](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/)

As you can see, the self-identified party affiliation demographics are not 50-50 Democrat-Republican, they are closer to 33-33-33 Democrat-Independent-Republican. This mirrors the Borda count election outcome.

### Isn't the whole point of a voting system to discriminate political beliefs?

In a sense yes, but only to pick the candidate that is most compatible with the views of the people, not to arbitrarily cut out the beliefs of a third of people.

### Political beliefs ought to be discriminated against, they aren't legally protected, what's the big deal?

Yes, political beliefs aren't legally protected, but they correlate with things that ARE legally protected such as race, age, gender, religion, etc.

## What Correlates With Independent Beliefs?

- Age is the strongest protected correlary I found, 1/5 voters over 80yo consider themselves independents, compared to 1/2 voters under 25. Strangely, this is discriminatory/disadvantageous towards the *average* aged voter, the majority of people are discriminated against.
